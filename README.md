# Frontend Mentor interactive rating component coding challenge

Frontend Mentor [interactive rating component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub/interactive-rating-component-rJcY35wtsn) using PUG, SASS and JS.

You can view the final version [here](https://salvarez96.github.io/FEM-interactive-rating/), optimized for any display.

## Things I learnt doing this challenge:
- DOM manipulation.
- Sass preprocessor for CSS, where I used variables, imports and its basic synthax.
- Pug preprocessor for HTML, where I used variables, includes, iterations, interpolation and its basic synthax.
- Class manipulation with JS for interactive HTML tags.
- Copying the design by only using static images of what the final product should look like.
